    Returns a NxN array where element at [i, j] says if

    To see if two boxes do NOT collide, the check is if
    my left side is past the other's right side or
    my top side is past the other's bottom side

    This is done by creating one array of top-left pairs and one of bottom-right pairs.
    Then every element of top-left is compared to every element of bottom-right and
    the result is an NxN matrix of boolean pairs.

    The pairs are reduced to a single boolean by applying the or operation.
    Then the result at [i,j] is combined with the result at [j,i], giving the final
    result for each cell.

    That is negated to obtain whether two boxes cross each other.
