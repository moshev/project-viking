    Base class for animation states.
    An animation state is a state which has a list of associated frames
    and transitions to other animation states based on events.
    When an animation's list of frames is exhausted, the current animation state
    is sent None as an event. For looping animations, they should return themselves.

    Apart from the __transitions__ function mandated by BaseState,
    animation states must also either have a '__frames__' property containing
    an iterable of their states, or implement the __iter__ function
    and return an iterator over their frames.

    The default iterator uses the supplied list/tuple.
