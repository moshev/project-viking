 - Design:
  Every state object works like a function. It gets passed the current event and returns the next state object.
  Returning None removes the state machine from the list of objects
  Example:
  class looped_animation:
      def frame1(self, event):
          if event is frame tick event:
	      current_frame = frame_1
	      return self.frame2
	  else:
	      return self.frame1
      def frame2(self, event):
          if event is frame tick event:
	      current_frame = frame_2
	      return self.frame1
	  else:
	      return self.frame2

  Drawing works by iterating the list of game objects and looking for a 'graphics' attribute.
  Each object could be thought of as a collection of properties and event loops bound together.
  Each object's event loop can register for a set of events at the global event machine.
  The global event machine contains subgroups of events. Example:
  class looped_animation:
      def __init__(self, object):
          self.object = object

      def start(self):
          self.object.event_supplier.clock.register(self.frame1, {frame tick event})

  Some of the above functionality would probably be exported to classes or metaclasses,
  to handle the most common set-up code.
